- (optionally) git

### Installation

2. Navigate to the downloaded project directory (`poc-playwright-typescript-gui-api`)
3. (optionally) Switch to the appropriate branch (command `git checkout <branch_name>`)

## Running tests

The basic command to run tests is:

```bash
npx playwright test
```
The command above will run all tests (or only tests marked as `.only`, see [Playwright's documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-only) for details).

This basic command can take different arguments and parameters - see [Playwright's documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli#introduction) for details.
